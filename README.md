## Summary of work completed
A simple goal tracking API using the Laravel PHP framework. I mostly concerned myself with the MVC portion for the basic crud operations of all the components (goals, milestones, logs). This is how I would get started making a web application using laravel for the API in the back end and consuming the api with a VueJS SPA on the front end.
